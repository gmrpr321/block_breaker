name         : block breaker game

this is created using Python 3.10.2. just an attempt to create that classic old game we used to play in keypad phones. 

to run the game:
		
		1)run newgame.py
		2)control the board using left and right arrow keys

(the game is not smooth so any advice to make it better is welcome)
